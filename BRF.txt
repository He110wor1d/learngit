DEF:
BRF is a variant of k-means fot large data sets.
Assumes:
Dataset are normally distributed.
Algorithm:
Input: D:Large dataset,k:the number of cluters
Process:
Split D into chunks that can be fitted into memory. 
Initilaze chose k centroids by some approach.
for each chunks C:
	for each Points P:
		if P is close enough to a Centroid i:#Q1
			feed P into DSi	
	Summarize DSi and Adjust N,Sum,SumSqr
	Group others points with RS left in last round into CSs.
	if two clusters in CS are close enough:
		Merge the two clusters into one #Q2:
	the remanider points feed into RS
Points in RS and CSs feed into the closest clusters.

Q1:How to decide a point P (x1,x2,...,xd) whether is close to Centroid C(c1,c2,...,cd)?
Mahalanobis distance is less than a threshold:
normalize in each dimension: y = (P-C)/cita
d(x,c)=sqrt(sum(square(y)))
d(x,c)<2*sqrt(d) <=> P is close enough to C

Q2: Shoud 2 CS subclusters be combined?
try combined and compute the variance of combined subclusters
the variance is blow a threshold <=> should combined

Problem:
Assumeds clusters are normally distributed in each dimension.
And axes are fixed.
